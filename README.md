# Replicache TODO Sample

This repository contains a complete Relicache sample that implements a basic mobile Todo app.

## Server

The server is in the `serve` directory. It's a Zeit Now app in Go.

Persistence is against AWS Aurora (MySQL flavor).

### Development

1. Install [zeit now](https://zeit.co/download)
1. run `now login` to get zeit credentials
1. Get the Rocicorp AWS credentials and put them in (.aws/credentials) on your machine
1. Add `.env` file to the root of this repository containing:
   ```
   REPLICANT_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access key from .aws/credentials>
   REPLICANT_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret access key from .aws/credentials>
   REPLICANT_SAMPLE_TODO_ENV=dev_<your Rocicorp username>
   FCM_SERVER_KEY=<Firebase Cloud Messaging Server Key>
   ```
   For Rocicorp's internal values, see "passwords" in Google Drive.
1. Run unit tests with no parallelism ` go test -p 1 ./...`. Note: tests depend on RDS and are therefore flaky.
1. Run `now dev`

## Deploy

Just commit to origin/master, it is auto-deployed.

Alternately, you can deploy to your own staging environment with:

```
now deploy
```

## Schema

The schema we run against is managed in `schema.go`. Whenever it is changed, the db is dropped and re-created.

We don't currently attempt to migrate data between versions.

# Client

```
# Login
curl -d '{"email":"foo@bar.com"}' https://replicache-sample-todo.now.sh/serve/login

# Create a TODO
# If the List ID is unknown, it is implicity created.
curl -H 'Authorization: <userid>'  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": 1, "listID": 1, "text": "Take out the trash", "complete": true}' \
  https://replicache-sample-todo.now.sh/serve/todo-create

# Get current Client View
curl -X POST -d '{"clientID":"12345"}' -H "Content-type: application/json"\
  -H "Authorization: <userid>" https://replicache-sample-todo.now.sh/serve/replicache-client-view
```
